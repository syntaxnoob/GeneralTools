A python3 script that I used to transfer my google data from an HTML file to Json.

### Method

The script reads the html file to a string.
The first and last 'Searched for' items in the string will be found.
A while loop will extract the 'search' and 'date' form the string.
All the results well be saved to a search.json file

### Requirements
